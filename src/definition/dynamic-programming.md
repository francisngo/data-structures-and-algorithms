# What is dynamic programming? 

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them in to smaller subproblems. 

NOTE: Dynamic programming approach is different from divide and conquer approach (as used for merge sort and quick sort algorithms). While divide and conquer approach breaks the problem into independent subproblems and combines the solutions, dynamic programming breaks the problem into dependent subproblems. 

There are three important steps when solving problems with DP: 
1. Define the subproblems
2. Implement the recurrence that solves the subproblems 
3. Recognize and solve the base cases
