# What is an array data structure? 

An ordered collection/list of data elements (elements can be string, number, boolean, or objects). 

The index of an array is the number that identifies where a piece of data lives inside the array (In most programming languages, index starts at 0).

Most data structures are used in four basic ways, which are refered to as operations
- Read: Reading looks up from a particular spot within the data structure. With an array, this means looking up a value at a particular index
- Search: Searching looks for a particular value within a data structure. With an array, this means looking to see if particular value exists within the array, if so, which index is it at. 
- Insert: Insertion is adding another value to the data structure. With an array, this means adding a new value to an additional slot within the array
- Delete: Deletion is removing a value from the data structure. With an array, this means removing one of the values from the array.

## Reading

Reading from an array takes just one step. Because the computer has the ability to jump to any particular index in the array and peek inside.
