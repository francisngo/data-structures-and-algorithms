# What is a Circular Linked List data structure?

A circular linked list can have only one reference direction or a double reference as with doubly linked list. The only difference between circular linked list and a linked list is that the last element's next (tail.next) pointer does not make a reference to null, but to the first element (head)

A doubly circular linked list has a tail.next pointing to the head element and the head.prev pointing to the tail element
