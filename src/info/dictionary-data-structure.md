# What is a Dictionary data structure?

Sets, dictionaries, and hashes store unique values. In a set, we are interested in the value itself as the primary element. In a dictionary (or map), values are stored in pairs as [key, value]. The same goes for hashes (they store values in a pairs, such as [key, value]). 

A dictionary is used to store pairs, where the key is used to find a particular element. A dictionary is very similar to a set; a set stores [key, key] collection of elements, and a dictionary stores a [key, value] collection of elements.
