# What is a Tree data structure?

A tree consists of nodes with a parent-child relationship. Each node has a parent (with the exception of the first node at the top) and zero or more children. 

The top node of a tree is called the root. It is the node that does not have a parent. Each element of the tree is called a node. There are internal nodes and external nodes. An internal node is a node with at least one child. A node that does not have children is called an external node or leaf. 

A node can have ancestors and descendants. The ancestors of a node (except the root) are parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on. The descendants of a node are children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. 

Another terminology used with trees is the subtree. A subtree consists of a node and its descendants. 

The depth of a node consists of the number of ancestors. 

The height of a node consists of the number of the maximum depth of any node. A tree can also be broken down into levels.
